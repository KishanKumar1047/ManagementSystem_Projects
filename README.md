Here’s a combined README file for Hospital Management System and Bank Management System:

Management Systems in C++
Overview
This repository contains two comprehensive management system projects developed in C++:

1_Hospital Management System
2_Bank Management System
Both systems aim to streamline and automate the management of respective resources with user-friendly interfaces and efficient functionalities. These projects employ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and dynamic data structures.

Features
Hospital Management System
Patient Management:
Add, view, update, and discharge patient records.
Doctor Management:
Add, update, and view doctor profiles.
Appointment Scheduling:
Book, view, and cancel appointments.
File Handling:
Persistent storage for patients, doctors, and appointment data.
OOP Concepts:
Classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Bank Management System
Account Management:
Create, view, and update account details.
Delete accounts.
Transaction Management:
Deposit and withdraw funds.
View transaction history.
File Handling:
Persistent storage for account details and transactions.
OOP Concepts:
Classes, objects, and encapsulation for secure data management.
